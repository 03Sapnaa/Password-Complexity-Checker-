# Password-Complexity-Checker-
Objective:
Create a Python-based tool that evaluates the complexity of a password. The tool checks whether a password meets certain security criteria, such as length, use of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This tool helps users ensure their passwords are strong and secure.

Key Features:

Password Length: Checks if the password meets a minimum length requirement (e.g., 8 characters).
Character Variety: Ensures the password includes uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
Strength Scoring: Provides a score or rating based on the complexity of the password.
Feedback: Offers suggestions on how to improve weak passwords.
Explanation:
Complexity Criteria:

The code checks if the password meets five criteria: length, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
Scoring System:

The password is rated as "Strong," "Moderate," "Weak," or "Very Weak" based on how many criteria it satisfies.
Feedback Mechanism:

If the password doesnâ€™t meet all criteria, the program provides suggestions to improve it.
Command-Line Interface:

The program runs in a loop, allowing users to check multiple passwords until they type "exit."
Next Steps:
Enhance Feedback: Provide more detailed feedback on how to create stronger passwords.
GUI Implementation: Develop a graphical user interface to make the tool more user-friendly.
Integration: Consider integrating this tool into web applications or other systems where password security is crucial.
This project is a practical tool for anyone interested in improving their password security and can be further expanded with additional features!
